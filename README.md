# -Fashion-MNIST-Classification-and-Ensemble-Learning
Project Description:
This project focuses on exploring various classification algorithms using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and optimize different classifiers and then create an ensemble model that outperforms individual classifiers on the validation set. The dataset is first downloaded and loaded, and a validation set is created by selecting 10,000 samples from the training set. The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets with 50,000, 10,000, and 10,000 samples, respectively.

Steps:

1. Data Preparation and Exploration
Download and load the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Create a validation set with 10,000 samples from the training set.
Display a few sample images to visualize the data.

2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
Train a multinomial logistic regression (softmax regression) classifier.
Optimize hyperparameters to maximize performance.
Report training, validation, and testing performance.
Discuss the impact of hyperparameters on model performance.

3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Train a support vector machine classifier with various kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, etc.).
Optimize hyperparameters for each kernel to maximize performance.
Report training, validation, and testing performance.
Discuss the impact of hyperparameters and kernels on model performance.

4. Random Forest Classifier
Train a random forest classifier and analyze feature importance.
Optimize hyperparameters to maximize performance.
Report training, validation, and testing performance.
Discuss the impact of hyperparameters on model performance.

5. Ensemble Learning
Combine the individual classifiers into an ensemble model.
Experiment with different ensemble methods like voting, stacking, or boosting.
Optimize the ensemble model to outperform individual classifiers on the validation set.
Apply the optimized ensemble model on the test set.
Report the final performance and discuss the findings.

Project Conclusion:
In this project, we explore and optimize various classification algorithms, including Multinomial Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machines with different kernels, and Random Forest Classifier. Additionally, we combine these classifiers
into an ensemble model to achieve better performance compared to individual models on the validation set. 
The final model is then evaluated on the test set to confirm its effectiveness in classifying Fashion MNIST images.Project Description:
